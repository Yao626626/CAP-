As  all the form of question is multiple-choice question, and the number of question is less than twenty, 
certification of  CAP for tumor somatic mutation of  SNV/INDEL is much easy compared to CFDA  certification: There are two ways to processing this:
    The regular processing is: Select a software as vardict/strelka2 et.al according to the data type: hybrid capture or amplicon sequencing data,
                               then check the mutation conbined with cap and IGV verification.
    Another direct approach is upload the sorted bam file to the IGV without mutation calling step,and looking for the right choice from the multiple choices!
